      content="My name is Mikołaj, I'm currently 20 years old. 
      I love discover new thinks, such as many technologies, especially in IT sector. 
      This is my biggest hobby. For many years, I was self-studying. 
      Now I'm an undergraduate, my Alma Mater is Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice, Poland. 
      I gained some experience in Front-End, I know well basics and many advanced thinks, in languages and tools used in this branch, like JS, React, NPM, SCSS, Styled Components, Webpack etc. 
      I also trying to learn Back-End stack, such as Go, REST API, MongoDB, Firebase, Docker. 
      I can build everything, from little and cheap websites based on templates, to bigger and custom web applications with necessary solutions, like an e-commerce web platform. If you want to know more, I invite you to contact me :)"

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
