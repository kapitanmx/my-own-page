    For many years, I was self-studying. Now I'm an undergraduate, my Alma Mater is Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice, Poland.
    I gained some experience in Front-End, I know well basics and many advanced thinks, in languages and tools used in this branch, like 
    JS, React, NPM, SCSS, Styled Components, Webpack etc. I also trying to learn Back-End stack, such as Go, REST API, MongoDB, Firebase, Docker. 
    ${<br/>}
    I can build everything, from little and cheap websites based on templates, to bigger and custom web applications with necessary solutions, 
    like a web platform. If you want to know more, I invite you to contact me :)`,
