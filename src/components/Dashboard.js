            <p>My name is MikoÅ‚aj, I'm currently 20 years old. I love discover new thinks, such as many technologies, especially in IT sector. 
            For many years, I was self-studying. Now I'm an undergraduate, my Alma Mater is Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice, Poland.
            I gained some experience in Front-End, I know well basics and many advanced thinks, in languages and tools used in this branch, like 
            JS, React, NPM, SCSS, Styled Components, Webpack etc. I also trying to learn Back-End stack, such as Go, REST API, MongoDB, Firebase, Docker.
            Of course, I can using Git :)</p>
